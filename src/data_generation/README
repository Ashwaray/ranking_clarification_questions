The original Stack Exchange data dump used to generate this dataset can be found here: https://archive.org/download/stackexchange
NOTE: Data for the domains: askubuntu.com, unix.stackexchange.com & superuser.com is already included in this repo

To generate the clarification questions dataset from the data dump for any other site, follow the steps below:

1. Choose a sitename from the list of sites in the link above. Let's say you chose 'academia.com'
2. Download the .7z file corresponding to the site i.e. academia.com.7z and unzip it under ranking_clarification_questions/stackexchange/
3. Set "SITENAME=academia.com" in ranking_clarification_questions/src/data_generation/run_data_generator.sh
4. cd ranking_clarification_questions; sh src/data_generation/run_data_generator.sh

This will create data/academia.com/post_data.tsv & data/academia.com/qa_data.tsv files
